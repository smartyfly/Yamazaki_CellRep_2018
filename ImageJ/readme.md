# List of ImageJ (Fiji) scripts (in the order of processing):
- **AutoROI.ijm**
generates regions of interest (ROI) automatically based on Ch2 (GCaMP6f) signal and save it as "AutoROI.zip".

- **splitROI.ijm**
generates 'AND' ROI from two overlapping ROIs. This was used to make ROIs manually drwan and the ROI generated by AutoROI.ijm. Load AutoROI.zip first and draw a manual ROI that orverlaps with the loaded one(s) and register it to ROI manager, then excute this script. This will save a new "AutoROI_man.zip" file.

- **dF_batch.ijm**
generates dF/F0 images and save them to a folder "dF_F0_Ch2" in the same directory of selection. Modify some parameters like stimlation start time, time dureation for F0 averaging and median filter radius. Tiff file to be processed should contain the "time per frame" metadata.

- **trim_batch.ijm**
saves trimed tiff defined by ROIs in the ROI manager to the folder "trim2". If there are multiple ROIs, each tiff will be saved in separated directory like "roi1", "roi2" and so on.

- **(optional) ROI2PNG.ijm**
generates a PNG picture of a red channel overlayed ROIs. This may be usuful to check ROI.zip file in use visually.
